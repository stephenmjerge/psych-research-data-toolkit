# PRDT Documentation

Welcome! These short guides explain how to run the Psych Research Data Toolkit (PRDT) even if you are not a developer. Start with the Walkthrough to see the full pipeline, then refer to Concepts and Quickstart when you need refreshers.

| Guide | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Walkthrough](walkthrough.md) | From raw CSV → anonymized outputs → plots/alerts |
| [Concepts](concepts.md) | Reliability, missingness, PHI, drift summaries |
| [Quickstart](quickstart.md) | Copy/paste instructions for new machines/users |
| [Clinician Quickstart](clinician_quickstart.md) | One-page setup + troubleshooting for clinicians |

Each guide keeps screenshots/command snippets short so you can scan quickly during a busy clinic or study session.
