# Dataset A Drop Zone

Place the secure CSV for Dataset A here as `raw.csv`. This file is **not** tracked
in git; keep it on encrypted storage / synced drive only.

Steps:
1. Copy the latest export to this directory and name it `raw.csv`.
2. Run `scripts/run_dataset_a.sh` (or `prdt --config configs/dataset_a.toml`).
3. Remove the raw file after generating anonymized outputs.
